## First steps

Pigeon Importer is perfect for situations where CSV data are produced by your system and only way
you can export them is e-mail. 

Assume this table as sample CSV produced by your system:

| date | new | lost | total |
| ---| --- | --- | --- |
| 2016-03-29 | 8 | 5 | 256 |
| 2016-03-30 | 9 | 1 | 264 |
| 2016-03-31 | 15 | 3 | 276 |

And you need this table to be available to join with other data in Keboola Connection.

That's the place for Pigeon Importer.

## Tips and Tricks

- Also gzipped CSVs as attachments are allowed
- Every CSV file should have its own configuration (otherwise you'll get into error where columns
differ)
- To automate downloading of attachments regularly, setup Orchestration

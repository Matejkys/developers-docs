You can look at Keboola Connection as a system of independent and loosely coupled microservices. Each microservice has its own code base, and a publicly accessible API and configuration. 
We do not cheat or have any advantage over other developers; our UI and other components use only these public APIs. 
As a result, it's very easy to, for example, write custom scripts to bootstrap a project, or do something that our UI does not offer. 
Let's have a look into this!

## Common

All components share a common behaviour base. 

### Components API

Each component has a `/run` API call that accepts its configuration in JSON body and queues the job. For more details, see the [full API description](http://docs.keboolaconnector.apiary.io/#reference/sample-coponent's-api-calls-required-for-orchestration).

### Components Configuration

All components store their configuration in [Storage API Components Configurations](http://docs.keboola.apiary.io/#reference/component-configurations). Stored configurations can be referenced in `/run` API calls.

A configuration can be defined with a JSON schema stored within the Component detail. Docker Extensions without their own schemas can use a generic [Docker Extension schema](/overview/docker-bundle/#configuration).

You can look at Keboola Connection as a system of independent and loosely coupled microservices. Each microservice has its own code base, and a publicly accessible API and configuration. 
We do not cheat or have any advantage over other developers; our UI and other components use only these public APIs. 
As a result, it's very easy to, for example, write custom scripts to bootstrap a project, or do something that our UI does not offer. 
Let's have a look into this!

One of the very important components is [Storage](/integrate/storage/), which not only stores all the data in
project, but also provides additional functions such as managing other components 
and their configurations. When you are integrating your systems with KBC, 
**chances are that you want to start with [Storage](/integrate/storage/)**.

## Common

All components share some common behaviour. Each component has *Component API* which allows it
to be run in [Orchestrations](https://help.keboola.com/automate/) and *Component Configuration*. 

### Components API

Each component has a `/run` API call, that accepts either a reference to component configuration
(`config` field) or full component configuration (`configData` field) in JSON body and 
[queues an asynchronous job](/overview/jobs/).  
For more details, see 
[full API description](http://docs.keboolaconnector.apiary.io/#reference/sample-coponent's-api-calls-required-for-orchestration).
What each component does is defined purely by that component, so is the contents of the configuration.
The common property is that each component has `/run` which accepts configuration in some form.

### Components Configuration
All components store their configuration in [Storage](/integrate/storage/). Management of the
configurations is done thru   
[Storage Components Configurations API](http://docs.keboola.apiary.io/#reference/component-configurations). 
Stored configurations can be referenced in `/run` API calls.

Configuration can be defined with a JSON schema, that is stored within the Component detail. 
Docker Extensions without their own schemas can use a generic 
[Docker Extension schema](/overview/docker-bundle/#configuration).

## Specific Components

Apart from the above common API, some components offer other API calls:

  - [Storage](/integrate/storage/)
  - [Transformations](/integrate/transformations/)

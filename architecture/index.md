Keboola Connection (KBC) is a system composed of many components orchestrated together through (mostly REST) APIs. The whole system is quite complex, but because of it's component nature, you rarely need to work with more then few components. Most of our componts have a public [github repository](). All of our components have API documentation on [Apiary]. Our docker components are build either on [DockerHub] or [Quay]. Everything you can do in the KBC UI can be done programatically using the API of the corresponding component.

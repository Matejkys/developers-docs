Introduction

Hello, we are the developers of KBC. 
KBC is a quite complex system consisting of many (like hundreds) interconnected components. During our work days we often encounter some interesting, some complex and some tough problems. In this blog we would like to share some of the knowledge and experience we gained when solving those problems. We will try to describe our solutions and approaches and we'd like to hear your opinions on them. We reserve the right to write about things without solutions (in hope that you may help us with them). If you'd like to hear about something specific, do not hesitate to contact us.

This blog will contains technical articles (sometimes more, sometimes less):
- expect no marketing bullshit
- expect bi-weekly to monthly period (we won't disturb you daily)
- expect no status updates about KBC (for that we have status.keboola.com)

We hope that you will like this.

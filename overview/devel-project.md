If you are a 3rd party developer working with KBC, chances are that you do not have an access to
a project in KBC. It is not strictly necessary to have a KBC project, but it certainly helps,
so that you can test your code in action. 

You can apply for a development project with the following features:

- 50GB storage space
- 50M stored data rows
- Mysql backend
- 10 users
- 10 orchestrations
- Possibility to create a demo development project in GoodData with 1GB storage and 30 users (expires in 1 month)
 
Under the following conditions:

- You do not belong to a company which already has a project in KBC
- Fair use (do not abuse it or use it for production)
- Write an email to devel@keboola.com
- Remain active in the development

If you wish to apply for a KBC project, send us an email (use the following template if you are lazy):

Hello,
I'am XZ (from XY) and I'd like to develop a XY component for KBC. TODO :)

If you are a 3rd party developer working with KBC, chances are that you don't have access to
a project in KBC. It is not strictly necessary to have a KBC project, but it certainly helps
so that you can test your code in action. 

You can apply to have development project with the following features:
- 50GB storage space
- 50M stored data rows
- Mysql backend
- 10 users
- 10 orchestrations
- possibility to create a demo development project in Goodata with 1GB storage and 30 users (expires in 1 month)
 
 Under the following conditions:
- you don't belong to a company which already has a project in KBC
- fair use (don't abuse it, don't use it for production)
- write email to devel@keboola.com
- remain active in development

If you wish, you can apply by sending us an email (use the following template if you are lazy):

Hello,
I'am XZ (from XY) and I'd like to develop component XY for KBC. TODO :)

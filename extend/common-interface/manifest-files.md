A manifest file gives additional information about tables and files injected to the `/data/in` folders. It also provides a way to specify options for tables and files transferred back to Storage from `/data/out` folders. Manifest files have a `.manifest` suffix to the original file.

All files in `/data/in` have the manifest file mandatory and injected. For files generated by your code in `/data/out`, the manifest file is optional.

## Format

The format of the manifest file is always *JSON* for [Custom Science](/extend/custom-science/) and *JSON* or *Yaml* for [docker extensions](/extend/docker/) depending on what you have chosen in [Component registration](/extend/registration/).

The format of the file is defined in the component/application definition. It can be `yaml` or `json`; the examples displayed here are in `yaml`.

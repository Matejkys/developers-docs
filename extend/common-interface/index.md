To exchange data between your app and Keboola Connection both Custom Science and Docker Extensions use a predefined set of structured folders and files and [configuration file](/extend/common-interface/config-file/). Your application can expect input files from a given folder. Your application is required to produce its results to another defined folder.

`/data` is the root folder for exchanging data. Keboola Connection takes care of injecting required tables and files and picking up tables and files generated by your code. The data folder contains actual data files (tables and files) and metadata. For each datafile a [manifest file](/extend/common-interface/manifest-files/) is created which contains metadata information (keys for the table, creation time, etc.). 

## Structure

The predefined data exchange folder structure is following
  
    /data/in/tables
    /data/in/files
    /data/out/tables
    /data/out/files

### `/data/in/tables`

Tables defined in the input mapping are serialized in CSV format:
 
  - string delimiter `"`
  - separator `,`
  - no escape character
 
File names are specified in the input mapping, defaulting to `{tableId}.csv` (file name can be changed in UI). Table metadata is stored in the [manifest file](/extend/common-interface/manifest-files/).

### `/data/in/files`  

Files defined in input mapping are stored in their raw form, file names are numeric and are equal to `{fileId}_{filename}` in Storage. All other information about the file is available in the [manifest file](/extend/common-interface/manifest-files/).

### `/data/out/tables`

CSV files stored in this folder are available in the output mapping and can be transferred to Storage. The destination table in Storage is defined

  - in the output mapping
  - by the name of the file (eg. `out.c-data.my-table.csv`)
  - using the file name and `defaultBucket` option (eg. `my-table.csv`)
  - in the [manifest file](/extend/common-interface/manifest-files/)
  
The expected CSV format is:

  - string delimiter `"`
  - separator `,`
  - no escape character

[Manifest file](/extend/common-interface/manifest-files/) can specify a different format.

### `/data/out/files`

All files in this folder are uploaded to Storage. File names are preserved and tags and other upload options can be specified in the [manifest file](/extend/common-interface/manifest-files/).

To exchange data between your extension and Keboola Connection, use 

* a predefined set of input and output [folders](/extend/common-interface/folders) for tables and files,  
* a [configuration file](/extend/common-interface/config-file/), and 
* [environment](/extend/common-interface/environment/) variables, return values and standard output/error. 

Additionally, [Docker Bundle](/overview/docker-bundle/) provides tools for 
[encryption](/overview/encryption) and [Oauth2 authorization](/extend/common-interface/oauth/).
